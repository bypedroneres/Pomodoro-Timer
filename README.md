<h3>✺ Pomodoro Timer ✺</h3>

The Pomodoro Timer project aims to create a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. This technique helps users manage their time effectively by breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

<h4>✹ Goal ✹</h4>

The main objective of the Pomodoro Timer project is to provide users with a structured method for enhancing focus and productivity. By following the Pomodoro Technique, users can improve their time management skills and maintain a balance between work and rest.

<h4>✹ Design ✹</h4>

The Pomodoro Timer features a minimalist and user-friendly design. The interface focuses on displaying the remaining time for the current work interval or break. Visual cues, such as color changes, are used to indicate when a work interval transitions to a break or vice versa.

<h4>✹ Features ✹</h4>

* <b>Pomodoro Technique:</b> The timer follows the Pomodoro Technique, consisting of work intervals and short breaks. It helps users stay focused and maintain productivity.
* <b>Customizable Timer:</b> Users can adjust the duration of work intervals and breaks according to their preferences and needs.
* <b>Start, Stop, and Reset:</b> The timer provides controls to start, stop, and reset the countdown.
* <b>Audio Notifications:</b> The timer plays audio notifications to indicate the end of a work interval or break.
* <b>Progress Tracking:</b> Users can keep track of completed work intervals and breaks, providing a sense of accomplishment.

<h4>✹ Technologies Used ✹</h4>

The Pomodoro Timer project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for the structure of the timer interface, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for the timer functionality and user interactions.

<h4>✹ What I've Learned ✹</h4>

* <b>JavaScript Timing Events:</b> Through the development of the Pomodoro Timer, I gained experience in working with JavaScript timing events, such as `setInterval`, to create countdown functionality and handle time-based events.
* <b>DOM Manipulation:</b> Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript allowed me to dynamically update the timer display and interact with user input.
* <b>User Experience Design:</b> Designing a user-friendly interface and incorporating visual cues improved my understanding of user experience design principles and the importance of providing clear feedback to users.
